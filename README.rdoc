== MongoDB Rails 3 App Skeleton

This is just a sample app skeleton for an application with Rails 3, MongoDB, and MongoMapper.

The relevant files are:

* config/application.rb
* Gemfile
* config/initializers/mongo.rb
* app/models/user.rb (as an example)

To start the server:
rails server

To start the console and play with the user model:
rails console

All of this assumes that you've installed Rails 3 and have a mongod process running.
